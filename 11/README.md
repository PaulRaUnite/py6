# The iterable and iterator

## Formulation
Provide your own iterable object. Experiment with different iteration techniques.

Iterable from [dsl1](https://github.com/PaulRaUnite/dsl_lab1).
Object iterable + iterator is suitable when it's finite or "straight" collection like a file.
Generator is suitable when we code a iterable with external iterator but don't want code it manually.
External user-defined iterator is suitable for creating complex cases.
